# TODO there has to be some annotation which triggers helm to
# render the annotations block in the deployment.yaml, or else
# it'll be an empty map with a key/value of "annotations:", and
# it'll cause a weird yaml rendering junk.

# as such, for the time being we're just going to include a placeholder annotation
#
# alternatively, we can turn on "metrics" and use podAnnotations
# such as prometheus.io/scrape which will substitute this and work
